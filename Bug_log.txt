CHECKPOINT 1

Date Found: 10/16/16
Bug: RTC handler only called once
Solution: Resolved by setting interrupt flag in handler

Date Found: 10/16/16
Bug: Keyboard printed while on exception "blue screen"
Solution: Clear interrupts at the start of exception handlers


CHECKPOINT 2

Date Found: 10/22/16
Bug: Nothing was printed to the screen when reading a file (frame0.txt, frame1.txt)
Solution: Set the inode number by reading the value from the module that was launched in Kernel.c instead of hardcoding a value to it

Date Found: 10/22/16
Bug: File system not accessing the correct inodes and datablocks
Solution: Solved it by setting appropriate parentheses to make sure that arithmetic was done before typecasting. Typecasting before doing arithmetic resulted in incorrect placemarkers of the start of the inode blocks and data blocks

Date Found: 10/22/16
Bug: File system not reading complete information from datablocks
Solution: increment the index in the read loop so that the appropriate datablock index in the inode is accessed

Date Found: 10/22/16
Bug: RTC caused page fault when handler was called
Solution: Added assembly linkage from IDT to handler function

Date Found: 10/22/16
Bug: Keyboard handler entered if statement without meeting condition and caused page fault
Solution: Resolved by adding assembly linkage

Date Found: 10/22/16
Bug: Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Caps lock key presses sometimes behave as "sticky keys"
Solution: Resolved by sending sti and EOI and end of handler


CHECKPOINT 3 & 4

Date Found: 11/4/16
Bug: Execute causing page fault after the iret instruction.
Solution: Load ds register with user data segment, change esp values for the user, load full program image into memory

Date Found: 11/7/16
Bug: Page fault exception with execute
Solution: Constant was 8mb when it was supposed to be 128mb

Date Found: 11/7/16
Bug: Page fault exception handler does not output correct information
Solution: Fixed so that the virtual address, address being accessed, and cs values are displayed

Date Found: 11/7/16
Bug: Page faults in general
Solution: Flush the TLBs when repaging 


CHECKPOINT 5

Date Found: 12/3/2016
Bug: OS was "triple page faulting" and "double page faulting"
Solution: Solved by restoring and saving the TSS esp0 value

Date Found: 12/3/2016
Bug: Divide-by-Zero exception
Solution: Initialize the rtc rates

Date Found: 12/4/2016
Bug: Paging errors
Solution: Used bitwise OR and AND operations (aka | & ) instead of || && when adding flags to a physical address value

Date Found: 12/4/2016
Bug: Fish program appears in other terminals when it is only called in one
Solution: 1) Flush the TLBs in newly created page-remapping functions, 2) Map the user video memory page when switching terminals

Date Found: 12/4/2016
Bug: Fish wont show up unless characters were drawn over the position where the fish program was to be displayed
Solution: Initialize during scheduling the video memory buffer for each terminal to spaces (they were NULL before)
